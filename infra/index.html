  <h1>AquAPI (like an API but it's better because Aqua)</h1>
  <h2>because you can't query for Aqua on waifu.pics</h2>

    This is the domain where all of the images of our wonderful goddess are stored. But if you want to actually get some of those images, you'll have to use <a href="https://aquapi.sapslaj.com/">the API</a>!
